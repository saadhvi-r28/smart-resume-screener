## 🔥 What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Add Your Mistral API Key (REQUIRED)

```bash
# Open the .env file
nano /Users/saadhviram/Documents/College/Companies/Unthinkable/smart-resume-screener/backend/.env

# Find this line:
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key_here

# Replace with your actual key from https://console.mistral.ai/
MISTRAL_API_KEY=abc123your-actual-key-here

# Save and exit (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter)
```

### Step 2: Start Your Server

```bash
cd /Users/saadhviram/Documents/College/Companies/Unthinkable/smart-resume-screener
./start-server.sh
```

**OR manually:**

```bash
cd /Users/saadhviram/Documents/College/Companies/Unthinkable/smart-resume-screener/backend
npm start
```

### Step 3: Test Your API

Open a **new terminal** and run:

```bash
cd /Users/saadhviram/Documents/College/Companies/Unthinkable/smart-resume-screener/backend
node test-api.js
```

## 🎊 You're Done!

Once you complete the 3 steps above, your project will be fully operational!

## 📚 Available Commands

### Start the Server
```bash
./start-server.sh                    # Automated start (recommended)
cd backend && npm start              # Manual start
```

### Test the API
```bash
cd backend && node test-api.js       # Run all tests
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health   # Quick health check
```

### MongoDB Commands
```bash
brew services start mongodb-community@8.0   # Start MongoDB
brew services stop mongodb-community@8.0    # Stop MongoDB
brew services list | grep mongodb           # Check status
```

## 📖 Documentation Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `SETUP_COMPLETE.md` | Complete setup summary and status |
| `QUICKSTART.md` | Detailed setup and usage guide |
| `README.md` | Project overview and architecture |
| `DEMO_SCRIPT.md` | Demo walkthrough |
| `backend/test-api.js` | API test suite |

## 🔍 Quick Health Check

Run these commands to verify everything is working:

```bash
# 1. Check MongoDB is running
pgrep -x "mongod"
# Should output a process ID number

# 2. Check server is running (after starting it)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}

# 3. List resumes
curl http://localhost:3000/api/resumes
# Should return: [] or list of resumes
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Keep MongoDB Running**: MongoDB runs as a background service, so it will auto-start on reboot
2. **API Key Security**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control
3. **Cost Control**: The project is configured for minimal Mistral API costs
4. **Testing**: Always run `test-api.js` after making changes

## 🆘 Need Help?

Check these files in order:
1. `SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - Setup status and troubleshooting
2. `QUICKSTART.md` - Detailed instructions
3. Look at the backend server logs for specific errors

## ✨ What's Working

- ✅ MongoDB installed and running
- ✅ Backend server configured and tested
- ✅ Mistral AI integration complete
- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ Cost-optimized configuration
- ✅ Test suite ready
