# 🤖 What the LLM (Mistral AI) Does in This Project

## Overview

This Smart Resume Screener uses **Mistral AI** (experimental endpoint) to provide intelligent resume analysis and candidate-job matching. The LLM acts as an expert HR recruiter to evaluate resumes against job requirements.

---

## 🎯 Main Functions of the LLM

### 1. **Resume vs Job Matching (Primary Function)**

**What it does:**
- Compares a candidate's resume with a job description
- Provides an AI-powered match score (1-10 scale)
- Analyzes how well the candidate fits the role

**Process:**
```
Resume Data + Job Description → Mistral AI → Detailed Match Analysis
```

**Input to LLM:**
- **Resume data**: Skills, experience, education, certifications
- **Job requirements**: Required skills, experience level, responsibilities

**Output from LLM:**
```json
{
  "overallScore": 8.5,
  "skillsScore": 9,
  "experienceScore": 8,
  "educationScore": 9,
  "reasoning": "Strong technical match with relevant experience...",
  "strengths": ["10+ years Java experience", "AWS certified"],
  "weaknesses": ["Limited Python experience"],
  "recommendations": ["Interview for senior role"],
  "matchedSkills": ["Java", "AWS", "React"],
  "missingSkills": ["Python", "Docker"],
  "experienceHighlights": ["Led team of 5 developers"],
  "riskFactors": ["Frequent job changes"]
}
```

## 🔧 How It Works Technically

### **Step 1: Resume Upload**
```
User uploads PDF/TXT → Backend parses text → Extracts structured data
```

### **Step 2: Data Extraction (Rule-Based)**
The `ResumeParserService` extracts:
- Skills (matched against 350+ known skills)
- Experience (years, companies, positions)
- Education (degrees, institutions)
- Certifications

**Note:** This parsing is NOT done by LLM - it's rule-based regex matching for cost savings!

### **Step 3: LLM Analysis (When Matching)**
```javascript
// When you click "Find Matches" on a job
POST /api/matches/find

// LLM receives this prompt:
const prompt = `
RESUME DETAILS:
Name: John Doe
Skills: JavaScript (expert), Python (intermediate), AWS (beginner)
Experience: 5 years as Full Stack Developer
Education: BS Computer Science

JOB REQUIREMENTS:
Title: Senior Full Stack Developer
Required Skills: JavaScript, React, Node.js, AWS
Experience: 5+ years
Responsibilities: Lead development team, design architecture

TASK: Rate this candidate's fit (1-10) and explain why.
`;
```

### **Step 4: AI Response Processing**
```javascript
// Mistral AI returns analysis
{
  overallScore: 8.5,
  reasoning: "Strong JavaScript skills match requirements...",
  strengths: ["5 years experience", "JavaScript expert"],
  missingSkills: ["React", "Node.js"]
}
```

## 💰 Cost Optimization Features

### **Why Mistral AI Experimental?**
- **10-100x cheaper** than GPT-4
- Experimental endpoint = even lower cost
- Suitable for testing and development

### **Cost-Saving Configurations:**
```javascript
{
  model: 'mistral-tiny-experimental',  // Smallest, cheapest model
  temperature: 0.1,                     // Lower = more consistent, faster
  max_tokens: 512                       // Limit response length (was 1536)
}
```

**Savings:**
- Max tokens reduced by **67%** (1536 → 512)
- Using experimental endpoint
- Using tiniest model available

## 📁 Where LLM is Used in Code

### **File: `backend/src/services/LLMService.js`**

**Key Functions:**

1. **`compareResumeWithJob(resumeData, jobDescription)`**
   - Main matching function
   - Sends data to Mistral AI
   - Returns match analysis

2. **`getSystemPrompt()`**
   - Defines LLM's role as HR expert
   - Sets analysis framework
   - Specifies response format

3. **`buildComparisonPrompt()`**
   - Formats resume + job data
   - Creates structured prompt for LLM

4. **`parseResponse()`**
   - Extracts scores and insights
   - Handles JSON parsing
   - Validates LLM output

### **API Endpoints Using LLM:**

```javascript
POST /api/matches/find
// Body: { jobId: "xyz", candidateIds: ["abc", "def"] }
// Returns: Array of match scores with AI analysis

POST /api/matches/job/:jobId/resume/:resumeId
// Returns: Detailed match analysis for one candidate-job pair
```

## 🎯 Scoring Scale

| Score | Meaning | Recommendation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| 9-10  | Exceptional match | **Hire immediately** |
| 7-8   | Strong match | **Highly recommend interview** |
| 5-6   | Good match | **Consider with reservations** |
| 3-4   | Moderate match | **Significant gaps, risky** |
| 1-2   | Poor match | **Not recommended** |

## 🚫 What LLM Does NOT Do

### **Resume Parsing ❌**
- Extracting skills from text
- Finding experience years
- Parsing education
- Detecting email/phone

**Why?** Rule-based parsing is:
- ✅ Faster
- ✅ Cheaper (no API calls)
- ✅ More predictable
- ✅ Sufficient for structured data

### **File Processing ❌**
- PDF to text conversion (done by `pdf-parse` library)
- Text cleaning and normalization
- Keyword matching

## 💡 Example Workflow

### **Scenario: Hiring a Senior Developer**

**1. Create Job Posting**
```javascript
POST /api/jobs
{
  title: "Senior Full Stack Developer",
  skills: ["JavaScript", "React", "Node.js", "AWS"],
  experienceLevel: "Senior",
  requirements: {
    minimumExperience: 5,
    requiredSkills: ["JavaScript", "React"]
  }
}
```

**2. Upload Resume**
```javascript
POST /api/resumes/upload
// PDF file uploaded
// System extracts: 15 skills, 5 years experience
```

**3. Find Matches (LLM Activates Here!)**
```javascript
POST /api/matches/find
{
  jobId: "job123",
  candidateIds: ["candidate456"]
}
```

**4. Mistral AI Analyzes:**
```
Candidate: 5 years JavaScript, 3 years React, AWS certified
Job Needs: 5+ years JavaScript, React, AWS

AI Analysis:
✅ JavaScript experience matches
✅ React experience good
✅ AWS certification is bonus
❌ No Node.js experience mentioned

Overall Score: 7.5/10 - "Strong match, recommend interview"
```

**5. Results Displayed:**
- Match score: 75%
- Badge: "Good Match" (Yellow)
- Strengths, weaknesses, recommendations shown
